Bringing in the usual suspects
==============================

``` r
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_classic() + 
            theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
                  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
```

Bringing in tidyverse to do the heavy lifting with data cleaning, analysis and plotting.

Problem 1
=========

Data Wrangling
--------------

First, we need to bring in the data for analysis.

``` r
homicides = read.csv(file = "./data/homicide-data.csv") 
```

Like in the last homework, we'll create a `city-state` variable to hold a more descriptive name for each city. We'll need to filter out some cities that don't report race and then alter some columns on the victim characteristics.

``` r
cities_to_remove = c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO")
clean_homicides = homicides %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
         is_white = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "nonwhite"),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(is_white, "white"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         was_resolved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% cities_to_remove))
```

Our cleaning results in a dataset that is 48508 rows and 15 columns. This dataset will be used in our regression analyses.

Logistic Regression on Baltimore
--------------------------------

With this data, we'll use `glm` to create a logisitic regression to predict if a crime will be solved based on the victim's age, sex and race.

``` r
baltimore_glm = clean_homicides %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  glm(was_resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
      data = ., family = binomial())
```

With this model on hand, we can calculate the odds ratios needed for the problem.

``` r
coeffs = broom::tidy(baltimore_glm) %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) 

knitr::kable(coeffs)
```

| term                 |    estimate|  std.error|  statistic|    p.value|         OR|
|:---------------------|-----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| (Intercept)          |   1.0473606|  0.2265545|   4.622996|  0.0000038|  2.8501185|
| victim\_age          |  -0.0037403|  0.0030328|  -1.233272|  0.2174741|  0.9962667|
| victim\_sexMale      |  -0.8845347|  0.1361009|  -6.499110|  0.0000000|  0.4129062|
| victim\_racenonwhite |  -0.7929220|  0.1742183|  -4.551312|  0.0000053|  0.4525206|

From the table, we can see that homicide cases among non-whites are much less likely to be solved compared to cases among white people. The odds ratio is 0.453 with a p-value of 0, indicating statistically significant difference on a 95% confidence level.
